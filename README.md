# What it Does
==============================================

The application allows user to login or to create an account if they don't have account in the system. After the user login they can see all the product that is rendered from the Walmart API and they can add the item to their registry. The user can also delete the item from the registry. Then they can tell their friends and families to go the website and see the registry. The guest can search for the user and look at their registry.
